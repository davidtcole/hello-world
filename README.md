# hello-world
This is my first repository on Github, and will be used for the purpose of getting familiar with this development environment.

My name is David, and I am interested in getting involved in the development community. I haven't had a whole heck of a lot of experience doing anything beyond basic coding projects in C++ and Python, but I am eager to learn.

The plan is to get acquainted with PHP and mySQL so that I am able to contribute to current and future projects.
